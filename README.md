🌸 Iris Species Classifier

📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a simple yet effective Machine Learning model designed to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). 

This is one of my first hands-on projects as I work toward becoming an **AI Engineer**. I focus on moving from simple Decision Trees to more robust algorithms like **Random Forest**.

🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Library:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🧠 Model & Algorithm
* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Dataset:** The classic Iris Dataset (150 samples)
* **Goal:** To achieve high accuracy in multi-class classification while understanding the importance of the train-test split.
